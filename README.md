# Save Text Shortcut

A customizable solution for saving and processing web content across Apple devices using Shortcuts.

## Overview

This project emerged after discovering that simple text files work better than services like Pocket, Feedly, and Reeder for processing reading materials with AI locally.

## Features

* Cross-device compatibility on Apple ecosystem
* Freedom to read content in any app
* Metadata preservation (URL, date)
* Plain text storage (.txt or .md) for AI processing
* Cloud sync via iCloud or Dropbox

## Implementation

The solution leverages Apple Shortcuts with no additional dependencies. The main challenge involves macOS/iOS privacy settings requiring "Always Allow" access for each website. The included workaround uses a proxy server, requiring permission for only a single domain.
